# Why do I like development.
The main reason why I started develop applications connected with my job. Every day me and my colleagues have to make a lot of laborious, routine and recurring operations, that can be made in couple of seconds with the right program.
First solutions, that can hardly called "programs" I made using excel formulas and VBA scripts, and they helped to perform huge tasks in couple of minutes.
Some programs we still use every day, I rewrote them using java, but everyone is used to using old versions.
Then, when I have learned java I started to write more difficult programs for my work and now I use them in everyday work.
And when I realized, that logistic tasks need more complex solution I started to learn web-development.
As for my opinion it is the best way to solve our problems:
- United data storage.
- Ability to get the data you need in the form you need without routine operations.
- Workspace independence, you are not attached to the office and can get information you need with mobile phone.
- Data storage security.

Now I develop the web application that must combine different type of data, that my colleagues works with in one database. 
One part is done, and currently being tested. Next I want to engage in other parts of this application.
I don't have much experience and knowledge, and it takes a lot of time to get result that I need, that's why I want to become professional programmer.
Also an important reason why I chose this profession is an ability to improve my skill and work independence. Now I am a logistic-manager in railway transport and this is a rather narrow specialization. I can't work as a logistic manager in other country. And it will be hard to find a job in Ukraine, it's qite closed sphere of work, there were no new logistic-managers in our organization for two years.
Development can open more doors to me. Now I understood that I stopped my progress as logistic manager and one day I can become less competitive as others. I don't want to wait for this moment, now I see myselve as a developer, and I see were to use my knowledge and skills.

The main programming language that I work with is Java. Now I'm mostly develop web application and in my projects I use spring framework. In front-end I like to use vue.js. Now I study Angular, but I can't say that I know him well. To get access to SQL database I use Hibernate or Spring JPA.  Have a good skills in building SQL and JPQL queries. The general stack of technologies I work with is listed on my cv.
